# Nhanderu

Nhanderu is an Agile project management. Divided into a few diferent parts:

## Saga
Is a gamefied 360 feedback system composed of:

### Collaborator sheet
It is like a summary of the employee work on the company where he is evaluated by his peers, superiors and subordinates to give a more clear view on his strengths and weaknesses.

#### Levels
Just like in a videogame it helps identify the seniority of the employee on a quick glance. 
To keep leveling up the employee must complete some predefined challenges, reach the strategic goals and keep improving.
As the levels go up so goes the rewards that are available, like new training camps, a better healthcare plan, a raise and so on.

**Disclaimer**
Levels are not associated with the hierarchy of the company.

#### Patents
They are like the coat of arms, representing the hierarchical position of ones in the company.

#### Achievements
Just like in videogames, a proof that you completed a challenge. Can also be associated with a financial reward.

### Ranking
The best ones are on top.
